## What FairScan is not

FairScan is **not** intended to:
- provide fine-grained manual control over document processing
- replicate all features found in other scanning apps
- optimize for highly specific use cases at the expense of simplicity
 
---

## Compatibility

FairScan works on any device that:
- runs **Android 8.0+**
- has a camera

---

## Experimental: Scan to PDF via intent

FairScan can be invoked by other Android applications to perform a document scan and return a generated PDF.

This feature is **experimental** and intended for developers who want to rely on FairScan as a
simple, privacy-respecting scanning tool.
The intent contract and behavior may change between versions, and backward compatibility
is not guaranteed at this stage.

Intent action: `org.fairscan.app.action.SCAN_TO_PDF`

This is an **implicit intent** that launches FairScan in a dedicated external mode.

When started via this intent:

- FairScan opens directly in scan mode
- the user scans one or more pages
- FairScan generates a single PDF
- the resulting PDF is returned to the calling application as a URI with a limited lifetime
- the calling application should immediately copy the content of the URI as FairScan deletes it later

See an example app: [fairscan-intent-sample](https://github.com/pynicolas/fairscan-intent-sample)

## Technical details

FairScan uses:

- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose) for the UI
- [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/media/camera/camerax) for image capture
- [LiteRT](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert) to run the custom segmentation model for automatic document detection
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for perspective correction and image enhancement
- [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) for text recognition (OCR)
- [PDFBox-Android](https://github.com/TomRoush/PdfBox-Android) for PDF generation

## The segmentation model

FairScan uses a custom-trained image segmentation model to detect documents:<br>
https://github.com/pynicolas/fairscan-segmentation-model

It's based on a fully public dataset that is available here:<br>
https://github.com/pynicolas/fairscan-dataset

The build system automatically downloads the model using  
[`download-tflite.gradle.kts`](app/download-tflite.gradle.kts).
